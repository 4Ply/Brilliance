# Brilliance
### Datapack & Resourcepack
Brilliance is the name given to this datapack and resourcepack. It's combined effort of multiple people to help automate Decked Out 2, a minigame created by TangoTek.

The Resourcepack is essential in adding the many custom models, sounds, and textures required for this game to be clear and intuitive.

A brief list of what the Datapack controls:
 * Advancements 
 * Stat Tracking
 * Settings to adjust gameplay
 * Automating the dungeon
 * Vanilla Compatibility

While as brief this description is, it's an entirely complicated system that may be difficult to understand for developers.<br>
For additional documentation of some systems see the following:
 * [Advancement Documentation](./docs/advancements.md)
 * [Debugging Logs](./docs/logging.md)
 * [Scoreboard Documentation](./docs/scoreboard.md)
 * (TODO:) JSON documentation
