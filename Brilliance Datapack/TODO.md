# Other TODO:
- On datapack update to v0.7.4 or later. Remove command blocks -474 114 1948 in builder world
- Bomb droppers need to be auto refilled.
- Debate on whether Joe, False, XB's eggs should match the other 17 eggs or be like DO2
  - **_Currently_**: is matching the other 17 eggs. But we haven't discussed this.
  - Add a config for 1/2/3 rewards vs DO2 rewards.
- Debate adding either `tracked:0b` or `tracked:1b` to egg rewards.
  - `tracked:0b` counts the crowns as floor crowns. Makes it easier to find out total crowns this run.
  - `tracked:1b` counts the crowns as already tracked crowns.
  - **_Currently_**: is `tracked:1b` just so the crowns aren't broken until we discuss this.
- Automate adding `tracked:0b` to both the TnT dive chamber, AND in the L4 Hideout
- DM each person on the list of players in the credits tab ask them for a short description/saying/quote for their advancement.
- Check credit list to add ALL players to the credits tab.
- Debate on whether to kill all bats or leave them.
- Add a Tango Easter Egg to the dungeon, and automate it's score. 
  - **_(Builders need to hide egg first)_**
