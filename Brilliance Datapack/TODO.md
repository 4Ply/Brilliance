# Other TODO:
- Go into detail of the Fresh Runs, & Balance Changes in the config book.
- Finish the level interface book.
- Disable room controller when dungeon is online.
- Every 5s update markers upon lever change.
- Maybe have a config that lets the users change daylight/weather cycle.
  - Currently, these are enabled by default.
- update config documentation book
- Debate adding either `tracked:0b` or `tracked:1b` to egg rewards.
    - `tracked:0b` counts the crowns as floor crowns. Makes it easier to find out total crowns this run.
    - `tracked:1b` counts the crowns as already tracked crowns.
    - **_Currently_**: is `tracked:1b` just so the crowns aren't broken until we discuss this.
- DM each person on the list of players in the credits tab ask them for a short description/saying/quote for their advancement.
- Check credit list to add ALL players to the credits tab.
- Update advancements documentation to include whether the advancement has been tested to work.
    - Add missing advancements to the documentation.
- Move all HERMITCRAFT items from resourcepack/assets/do2 to resourcepack/assets/hermitcraft
- Remove dev/markers/controller eventually.
- Remove dev blocks at -626 58 2020
- Maybe track card vs natural stats:
  - Hazard
  - Clank
  - Treasure
