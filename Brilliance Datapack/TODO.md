# Other TODO:
 - Bomb droppers need to be refilled.
 - Add a Tango Easter Egg to the dungeon, and automate it's score.
 - Update the egg rewards to match the rewards hermits received in DO2
   - Debate adding either `tracked:0b` or `tracked:1b`
   - `tracked:0b` counts the crowns as floor crowns. Makes it easier to find out total crowns this run.
   - `tracked:1b` counts the crowns as already tracked crowns. 
 - Update do2:version after every update to determine whether datapack is up-to-date on the server.
 - On datapack update to v0.7.4 or later. Remove command blocks -474 114 1948
 - Stop warden and ravager dropping things on death.

## Testing Automation
We really need to test every single advancement to make sure they work exactly as how they should. Though this can only be done when we have access to the dungeon
