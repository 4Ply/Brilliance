# Other TODO:
 - Bomb droppers need to be refilled.
 - Summon Ravagers/Wardens should also summon the Evokers, Davy Bones, Willie
 - Somehow I forgot the Docm77 egg scoreboard ðŸ˜…
 - Use Noxitu's functions to automate setting egg scoreboard to 1, so `find_all_eggs` counter is automated.
 - Add a Tango Easter Egg to the dungeon, and automate it's score.
 - Need to have every OTHER tick, and every 4 ticks functions for optimization purposes.
    - 14/15 commands found can be run less often.
 - Add the trophies that are needed for TODO2's lobby. @MrBanana will let us know which ones soon.
 - Update the egg rewards to match the rewards hermits received in DO2
