# Other TODO:
 - Bomb droppers need to be auto refilled.
 - Add a Tango Easter Egg to the dungeon, and automate it's score.
 - Update the egg rewards to match the rewards hermits received in DO2
   - Debate adding either `tracked:0b` or `tracked:1b`
   - `tracked:0b` counts the crowns as floor crowns. Makes it easier to find out total crowns this run.
   - `tracked:1b` counts the crowns as already tracked crowns.
 - Update do2:version after every update to determine whether datapack is up-to-date on the server.
 - On datapack update to v0.7.4 or later. Remove command blocks -474 114 1948
 - Stop warden and ravager dropping things on death.
 - Automate adding `tracked:0b` to both the TnT dive chamber, AND in the L4 Hideout
 - DM each person on the list of players in the credits tab ask them for a short description/saying/quote for their advancement.
 - Check lobby to add ALL players to the credits tab.
 - Debate on whether to kill all bats or leave them.
 - First 4 tabs are out of order due to some visible advancements being auto granted every tick.
