So every single command block runs the SAME command.

/function do2:events/systems/on_hazard_event

I have it log to those that opt in, (check config area or run /trigger)
The log says: "Hazard Mechanism Activated"

Now I'd LIKE to have it be: "Hazard Mechanism Activated (Teleport Me)"
And on click of the "Teleport Me" you TP to the hazard.

HOWEVER, it's damn near impossible to do so... since ALL hazard event command blocks
are running the same function. It's near impossible to differentiate them.

So for now, I got a dirty hack implemented... It'd be best if each command block called a different function
like something:

/function do2:events/systems/on_hazard_event/001

However thats wishful thinking to modify EVERY command block, so for now I got this dirty fix in to get the job done
Don't judge me.
