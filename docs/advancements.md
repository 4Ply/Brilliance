# Advancements

Brilliance provides the player with several advancements that are obtainable through running the dungeon. Advancements range from exploring the many secrets of the dungeon and building a strong deck of cards. The advancements are split into 7 (8 including an empty) tabs of different categorized advancements namely: adventuring, survival, cards, treasure, phases, dlc, *empty* and credits.
